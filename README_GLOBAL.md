# 401k Payment Management System: Overview & Architecture


## System Architecture

This is a complete payment tracking system designed for managing 401k client payments with a three-tier architecture:

THIS IS A SMALL SCALE APP AT A LOCAL COMPANY
NO SECURITY IS REQUIRED
NO AUTHENTICATION IS REQUIRED
THIS APP IS ONLY USED BY ONE COMPANY, NO MULTI-TENANCY IS REQUIRED
LOCAL STORAGE IS USED FOR DOCUMENT STORAGE (ONEDRIVE)
THE APP WILL BE USED IN THE OFFICE.
ITS BEING BUILT AT HOME THAT IS WHY THERE ARE TWO MODES FOR DB PATH.
THE DB PATH WILL BE CHANGED TO OFFICE PATH WHEN THE APP IS MOVED TO THE OFFICE.

1. **Frontend (React/Next.js/TypeScript)**
   - Client/provider sidebar with toggle views
   - Payment entry and editing forms
   - Client details panel showing fee structure
   - Payment history table with pagination
   - Document upload and viewing capabilities
   - Dark/light theme support

2. **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**
   - RESTful API endpoints for data access
   - Business logic and data transformation
   - File/document management
   - Data validation and integrity checks

3. **Database (SQLite)**
   - Core data tables (clients, contracts, providers, payments)
   - Junction and summary tables for relationships and aggregations
   - Frontend-specific views optimized for UI needs
   - Triggers for automatic calculations (variance, summaries)
   - Temporal data tracking with valid_from/valid_to fields

## Key System Capabilities

The system tracks:
- Client information and their payment schedules
- Provider relationships
- Fee structures (percentage or flat fee)
- Monthly or quarterly payment periods
- Payment history with variance tracking
- Client documents and payment receipts
- Assets under management (AUM)

## Data Flow Architecture

What makes this system well-designed is the clear separation of concerns:

1. **Database** handles the heavy calculations and transformations through views and triggers
2. **Backend** serves as a thin transformation layer, mapping database views to frontend-expected JSON
3. **Frontend** focuses on presentation and user interaction

## Technical Implementation Details

- **Data Model:** Uses soft deletion pattern with timestamp fields for historical tracking
- **Period Handling:** Supports both monthly ("Jan 2024") and quarterly ("Q1 2024") formats
- **Fee Calculations:** Automatically computes expected fees based on rate type and AUM
- **Variance Tracking:** Calculates and displays differences between expected and actual fees
- **Document Management:** Links files to payments with metadata stored in the database

## Technical Strengths

The architecture demonstrates several best practices:
- Clean separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and database
- Purpose-built database views for frontend needs
- Efficient data transformation patterns
- Strong data integrity through triggers and constraints
- Historical data tracking through temporal design patterns

The system appears well-architected with a focus on maintainability, performance, and clear responsibility boundaries between each component.
