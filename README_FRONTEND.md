â€”-
You're already using SQLite as your data source, which is excellent! While this application will eventually expand to include multiple pages, we're currently focusing on the **Payment Management** page, which is the core functionality demonstrated in this wireframe.
## Integration Overview
The wireframe handles all UI rendering, state management, formatting, and user interactions. Your primary integration task is to ensure your backend provides the correct data structure that the frontend expects. The application uses a context-based data provider that expects a specific JSON structure.
Here's a simplified example of the JSON structure the frontend requires:
```json
{
  "clients": {
    "CL001": {
      "id": "CL001",
      "name": "Accelerate Technologies",
      "provider": "PR001",
      "providerId": "PR001",
      "providerName": "Fidelity Investments",
      "paymentSchedule": "Monthly",
      "feeType": "Percentage",
      "rate": 0.0625,
      "participants": 187,
      "clientSince": "05/12/2019",
      "lastAUM": 4783250,
      "lastAUMDate": "02/15/2024",
      "status": "Current"
    },
    "CL002": {
      "id": "CL002",
      "name": "Brightpath Solutions",
      "provider": "PR002",
      "providerId": "PR002",
      "providerName": "Vanguard",
      "paymentSchedule": "Quarterly",
      "feeType": "Percentage",
      "rate": 0.1875,
      "participants": 124,
      "clientSince": "08/23/2020",
      "lastAUM": 6254780,
      "lastAUMDate": "12/31/2023",
      "status": "Current"
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    "PR001": {
      "id": "PR001",
      "name": "Fidelity Investments",
      "clientCount": 5,
      "totalAssets": 78543250,
      "totalParticipants": 934
    },
    "PR002": {
      "id": "PR002",
      "name": "Vanguard",
      "clientCount": 4,
      "totalAssets": 54287600,
      "totalParticipants": 712
    }
  },
  "clientDetails": {
    "CL001": {
      "id": "CL001",
      "name": "Accelerate Technologies",
      "feeType": "Percentage",
      "rate": 0.0625,
      "rateBreakdown": { 
        "monthly": 0.0625, 
        "quarterly": 0.1875, 
        "annual": 0.75 
      }
    }
  },
  "paymentHistory": {
    "CL001": [
      {
        "id": "PMT001_CL001",
        "receivedDate": "03/05/2024",
        "appliedPeriod": "Feb 2024",
        "aum": 4783250
      }
    ]
  }
}

```
## Integration Approach
To successfully integrate your SQLite database with this frontend:
1. **Examine your database schema** to understand how your existing data maps to the required structure
2. **Create transformation functions** in your backend that query your database and shape the results into the expected JSON format
3. **Implement API endpoints** that serve this transformed data to the frontend
4. **Handle data mutations** (create/update/delete operations) from the frontend
The wireframe already handles:
- Client/provider selection and filtering
- Payment form validation and submission
- Payment history display with pagination
- Document viewing
- Theme switching and persistence
- All UI formatting and conditional styling
Your backend needs to focus on:
- Providing correctly structured data
- Calculating derived values (variances, rate breakdowns, etc.)
- Persisting changes to the database
- Serving document content when requested
## Key Database Operations
Beyond the initial data retrieval, your backend will need to handle these write operations:
1. **Adding Payments**: When a user submits the payment form, a new payment record should be created in your database, along with any calculated fields like variance and variance percentage.
2. **Updating Payments**: When a user edits an existing payment and submits the form, the corresponding record in your database should be updated with the new values.
3. **Deleting Payments**: When a user clicks the delete button on a payment record, that record should be removed from your database.
4. **Document Storage**: If a user attaches a document to a payment, your backend should store this document and create a reference to it in the payment record.
5. **Client Status Updates**: After payment operations, you may need to update client status information (like missing payments or last payment details) in your client records.
These operations should trigger appropriate updates to related data (like client totals or provider statistics) following your database's referential integrity rules.
## Using This Guide
The detailed guide below maps out every data-dependent element in the wireframe. For each component, it specifies exactly what JSON data is required and how it's used. Use this as a reference when implementing your backend integration to ensure all frontend features work correctly.
Rather than trying to modify your database schema to match this structure exactly, focus on creating a transformation layer in your backend that maps your existing data to the expected format.

### 401k Dashboard: Data Dependency Guide
This guide focuses exclusively on the JSON data dependencies that power the dashboard. It assumes developers have access to the source code and understand basic frontend concepts.
## Client List & Selection
### Client List Items
- **JSON Path**: `clients` array
- **Critical Fields**:
- `id` - Required for selection and lookup
- `name` - Primary display text
- `providerId` - Required for grouping in provider view
- `providerName` - Secondary display text
- **Data Note**: Missing clients will result in empty sidebar
### Provider List & Nested Clients
- **JSON Path**: `providers` array and `clients` filtered by `providerId`
- **Critical Fields**:
- `id` - Required for expansion state
- `name` - Primary display text
- `clientCount` - Displayed in provider summary
- `totalAssets` - Displayed as formatted currency
- **Data Note**: Provider view requires both arrays to function properly
## Client Details Card
### Client Identity & Status
- **JSON Path**: `clientDetails[selectedClient]`
- **Critical Fields**:
- `name` - Header display
- `missingPayments` - Controls status badge (empty array = "Current")
- **Data Note**: Status badge logic depends on `missingPayments` array length
### Fee Structure Section
- **JSON Path**: `clientDetails[selectedClient]`
- **Critical Fields**:
- `feeType` - Controls display format ("Percentage" or "Fixed")
- `rate` - Raw value (displayed as % or $ based on `feeType`)
- `rateBreakdown` - Object with monthly/quarterly/annual values
- `paymentSchedule` - Determines which rate breakdown to emphasize
- **Data Note**: Fee calculations throughout the app depend on these values being correct
### Last Payment Information
- **JSON Path**: `clientDetails[selectedClient]`
- **Critical Fields**:
- `lastPaymentPeriod` - Period label
- `lastPaymentExpected` - Raw number for expected fee
- `lastPaymentActual` - Raw number for actual fee
- `lastPaymentVariance` - Raw number for variance (drives conditional styling)
- **Data Note**: Variance styling depends on positive/negative/zero value
### AUM & Current Period
- **JSON Path**: `clientDetails[selectedClient]`
- **Critical Fields**:
- `lastRecordedAUM.amount` - Raw number for AUM
- `lastRecordedAUM.date` - Date string
- `currentPeriod.period` - Current period string
- `currentPeriod.status` - Status string (drives conditional styling)
- **Data Note**: Missing these fields will break the client details display
## Payment Form
### Form Population (Edit Mode)
- **JSON Path**: `paymentHistory[selectedClient][index]` (when editing)
- **Critical Fields**: All payment fields needed to populate form
- **Data Note**: Form expects complete payment object when in edit mode
### Expected Fee Calculation
- **JSON Path**: Uses `clientDetails[selectedClient].feeType` and `clientDetails[selectedClient].rate`
- **Critical Fields**:
- Client's `feeType` and `rate` - Used in calculation formula
- Form's `aum` value - User input that triggers calculation
- **Data Note**: This calculation happens in real-time as user types in AUM field
### Period Options Generation
- **JSON Path**: Uses `clientDetails[selectedClient].paymentSchedule`
- **Critical Fields**: `paymentSchedule` - Determines format of period options
- **Data Note**:
- "Monthly" schedule generates "Jan 2024", "Feb 2024", etc.
- "Quarterly" schedule generates "Q1 2024", "Q2 2024", etc.
## Payment History Table
### Payment Rows
- **JSON Path**: `paymentHistory[selectedClient]` array
- **Critical Fields**:
- `receivedDate` - Table cell content
- `appliedPeriod` - Table cell content
- `aum` - Table cell content (formatted as currency)
- `expectedFee` - Table cell content (formatted as currency)
- `actualFee` - Table cell content (formatted as currency)
- `variance` - Table cell content with conditional styling
- `variancePercent` - Displayed with variance
- `hasAttachment` - Controls document button state
- `attachmentId` - Used when viewing document
- **Data Note**: Missing or malformed payment data will break table rendering
### Pagination
- **JSON Path**: Length of `paymentHistory[selectedClient]` array
- **Data Note**: Pagination calculation depends on total number of payment records
## Document Viewer
### Document Display
- **JSON Path**: Uses `attachmentId` from selected payment
- **Critical Fields**: `attachmentId` - Used to fetch document content
- **Data Note**: Document viewer expects valid attachment IDs referenced in payment records
## Critical Calculations & Data Dependencies
### Expected Fee (Real-time)
- **Formula**: `feeType === "Percentage" ? aum * (rate / 100) : rate`
- **Data Dependencies**:
- Client's fee type and rate
- User-entered AUM value
- **Impact**: Affects form display and submitted payment data
### Variance & Variance Percentage
- **Formula**:
- Variance: `actualFee - expectedFee`
- Variance Percentage: `((actualFee - expectedFee) / expectedFee) * 100`
- **Data Dependencies**: Expected and actual fee values
- **Impact**: Drives conditional styling in payment history
### Client Status Determination
- **Logic**: Based on presence of items in `missingPayments` array
- **Data Dependencies**: `clientDetails[selectedClient].missingPayments`
- **Impact**: Controls status badge display and styling
### Period Options
- **Logic**: Generated based on client's payment schedule
- **Data Dependencies**: `clientDetails[selectedClient].paymentSchedule`
- **Impact**: Controls available options in period dropdown
This focused guide highlights only the critical data dependencies that would cause functionality issues if the JSON structure was incorrect or missing. Developers can reference the source code for implementation details of UI components and purely frontend functionality.
