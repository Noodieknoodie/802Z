"""
Application entry point.

This module sets up the FastAPI application, includes all routers,
configures middleware, and defines startup/shutdown events.
"""

def create_app():

    Create and configure the FastAPI application.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Create FastAPI instance with application metadata
    2. Configure local-only settings (minimal middleware)
    3. Include routers from endpoint modules:
       - clients.router
       - payments.router
       - providers.router
       - documents.router
    4. Register startup/shutdown event handlers
    
    This is the main entry point for the application,
    tying together all the components.
    
    Returns: Configured FastAPI application instance

    Initialize application resources on startup.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Ensure database connection is available
    2. Check for database schema updates or migrations
    3. Initialize document storage directory structure
    4. Log application startup
    
    This runs when the application starts and ensures
    all required resources are properly initialized.

    Clean up resources on application shutdown.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Close database connections
    2. Close any open file handles
    3. Log application shutdown
    
    This ensures clean termination of the application
    without resource leaks.
