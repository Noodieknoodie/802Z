Document handling business logic.

- File storage in local document directory
- File metadata tracking
- Association with payments

def store_document(file, client_id):
    """
    Store a document in the appropriate directory structure.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Extract file details (name, content, type)
    2. Generate safe filename with timestamp to avoid collisions
    3. Construct path using pattern: /documents/{client_id}/{safe_filename}
    4. Create directory if not exists
    5. Write file to disk
    6. Create metadata record in client_files table
    7. Return the generated file_id
    
    Why this matters:
    - Documents must be organized by client for easy access
    - Database needs to track document metadata and location
    - System must avoid filename collisions
    
    Returns: file_id of the newly created document record
    """
    pass

def associate_document_with_payment(file_id, payment_id):
    """
    Create an association between a document and a payment.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Verify both file_id and payment_id exist
    2. Check if association already exists
    3. Create new record in payment_files junction table
    4. Set linked_at timestamp
    
    Why this matters:
    - Documents may be shared between multiple payments
    - Junction table allows many-to-many relationship
    - Timestamps track when association was created
    
    Returns: Boolean indicating success
    """

def get_document_path(document_id):
    """
    Get the complete file system path for a document.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Query client_files table for document with given ID
    2. Extract onedrive_path from record
    3. Combine with base document directory to create full path
    4. Verify file exists at path
    
    This function translates database document references to actual file locations.
    
    Returns: Full filesystem path to the document
