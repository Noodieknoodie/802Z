Client business logic.

- Data aggregation from multiple tables
- Formatting for frontend consumption
- Missing payment detection
- Status determination

def get_frontend_client_data():
    """
    Build the complete frontend data structure for clients.
    Combines clients, providers, client details, and payment history.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Fetch client list from frontend_client_list view
    2. Fetch provider list and add clientCount and totalAssets aggregations
    3. For each client, fetch detailed information:
       - Create client details object with properly formatted rates
       - Calculate payment status using determine_payment_status()
       - Calculate expected fee correctly based on fee type
       - Generate missing payments array
    4. For each client, fetch payment history with pagination support
    5. Construct the final nested data structure matching frontend expectations
    
    Returns the complete JSON structure with clients, providers, clientDetails, 
    and paymentHistory objects.
    """

def determine_payment_status(client_data):
    """
    Determine if client payments are current or due based on payment schedule.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Get today's date
    2. Calculate current period (previous month/quarter):
       - For monthly: (current month - 1) or December of previous year
       - For quarterly: (current quarter - 1) or Q4 of previous year
    3. Extract client's last payment period from client_data
    4. Compare periods:
       - If client has no payments yet -> "Due"
       - If last payment period is older than current period -> "Due"
       - If last payment period is current or newer -> "Paid"
       
    This replaces the complex SQL logic from the deprecated view with
    more maintainable Python code.
    
    Returns: "Due" or "Paid"
    """

def calculate_expected_fee(client_data):
    """
    Calculate expected fee based on fee type and rates.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Check fee_type to determine calculation method
    2. For percentage fees:
       - Extract percent_rate (already in decimal form, e.g., 0.0075 for 0.75%)
       - Extract last_recorded_assets
       - Calculate: assets * percent_rate (directly, no division by 100)
       - Round to 2 decimal places for currency representation
    3. For flat fees:
       - Simply return the flat_rate value directly
    
    This fixes the calculation error in the old view where rates were
    incorrectly divided by 100 despite already being stored as decimals.
    
    Returns: Calculated fee as a decimal number, or None if calculation not possible
    """

def calculate_missing_payments(client_data):
    """
    Generate a list of missing payment periods for frontend status display.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. If payment status is "Paid", return empty array (no missing payments)
    2. Determine the client's last paid period from client_data
    3. Determine current period (same logic as in determine_payment_status)
    4. Generate all periods between last paid + 1 and current period:
       - For monthly: Create sequence like ["Jan 2024", "Feb 2024", ...]
       - For quarterly: Create sequence like ["Q1 2024", "Q2 2024", ...]
    5. Format each period as string according to frontend expectations
    
    Why this matters:
    - Frontend uses missingPayments.length to control status badge display
    - Empty array = "Current" status, non-empty = "Due" with specific periods
    - Provides detailed information rather than binary Paid/Due status
    
    Returns: Array of formatted period strings representing missing payments,
    or empty array if client is current
