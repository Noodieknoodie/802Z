"""
Payment business logic.

Handles complex payment-related operations:
- Payment creation with proper period handling
- Expected fee calculation
- Multi-period payment handling
"""

def parse_frontend_period(period_str):
    """
    Parse frontend period format into database fields.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Check if period is monthly (e.g., "Jan 2024") or quarterly (e.g., "Q1 2024")
    2. For monthly periods:
       - Extract month name and year
       - Convert month name to number (Jan=1, Feb=2, etc.)
       - Return dict with applied_start_month, applied_start_month_year, etc.
    3. For quarterly periods:
       - Extract quarter number and year from format "QX YYYY"
       - Return dict with applied_start_quarter, applied_start_quarter_year, etc.
       
    Why this matters:
    - Translates user-friendly period formats to database storage format
    - Critical for correctly recording which periods a payment covers
    - Database stores periods as numeric month/quarter + year fields
    
    Returns: Dictionary with appropriate period fields for database insertion

def calculate_expected_fee(client_id, total_assets, period):
    """
    Calculate the expected fee based on client fee structure and assets.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Fetch client contract details (fee_type, percent_rate, flat_rate)
    2. For percentage fee clients:
       - Calculate fee = total_assets * percent_rate (direct multiplication)
       - Handle multi-period payments by multiplying by number of periods
    3. For flat fee clients:
       - Return flat_rate
       - For multi-period payments, multiply flat_rate by number of periods
    4. Return the calculated value rounded to 2 decimal places
    
    This implementation correctly handles fee calculation without the 
    division by 100 error in the deprecated view.
    
    Returns: Expected fee as a decimal value
    """
    pass

def handle_multi_period_payment(payment_data):
    """
    Process a payment that spans multiple periods.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Extract start and end periods from payment_data
    2. Determine number of periods covered based on payment_schedule
    3. Create appropriate database field values:
       - For monthly: Set applied_start_month/year and applied_end_month/year
       - For quarterly: Set applied_start_quarter/year and applied_end_quarter/year
    4. Calculate expected fee for entire period span
    5. Return complete payment data ready for database insertion
    
    Why this matters:
    - Frontend allows selecting multiple periods for a single payment
    - Payment could cover multiple months or quarters
    - Must track both start and end periods for correct status determination
    
    Returns: Processed payment data with all required fields for database insertion
