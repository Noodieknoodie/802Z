Database connection and session management.

This module handles SQLite database connection, providing:
- Database initialization
- Connection pooling
- Session management
- Query execution utilities
"""

def get_db_connection():
    """
    Get a database connection from the connection pool.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Check if connection pool exists, create if needed
    2. Acquire connection from pool
    3. Set row_factory to dict_factory for dictionary-like result access
    4. Set pragmas for optimal SQLite performance:
       - foreign_keys = ON (enforce referential integrity)
       - journal_mode = WAL (better concurrent access)
    
    Why connection pooling matters:
    - Reuses database connections to reduce overhead
    - Limits total number of connections
    - Handles connection lifecycle
    
    Returns: SQLite connection with row factory set to dict
    """
    pass

def execute_query(query, params=None):
    """
    Execute a query with optional parameters.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Get database connection from pool
    2. Create cursor
    3. Execute query with params (using parameter substitution for safety)
    4. Fetch results as list of dictionaries
    5. Close cursor
    6. Return connection to pool
    
    Why parameter substitution matters:
    - Prevents SQL injection attacks
    - Handles data type conversion
    - Properly escapes special characters
    
    Returns: Query results as a list of dictionaries
    """
    pass

def execute_transaction(queries):
    """
    Execute multiple queries in a transaction.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Get database connection from pool
    2. Begin transaction
    3. Try to execute each query in sequence
    4. If any query fails, rollback entire transaction
    5. If all succeed, commit transaction
    6. Return connection to pool
    
    Why transactions matter:
    - Ensures database consistency
    - All-or-nothing operations
    - Prevents partial updates
    
    Returns: Boolean indicating transaction success/failure
