"""
Database models and query helpers.

This module defines functions for interacting with specific database tables,
including queries, transformations, and type handling.
"""

def get_all_clients():
    """
    Get all active clients from the frontend_client_list view.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Construct query to select from frontend_client_list view
    2. Execute query and fetch all results
    3. Sort clients by name for consistent ordering
    
    The frontend_client_list view already handles:
    - Joining necessary tables (clients, contracts, providers)
    - Filtering for active clients only (valid_to IS NULL)
    - Formatting client data as needed by frontend
    
    Returns: List of client dictionaries in frontend-expected format
    """
    pass

def get_client_details(client_id):
    """
    Get detailed client information from the frontend_client_details view.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Query frontend_client_details view with client_id filter
    2. Process JSON fields (percentRateBreakdown, flatRateBreakdown)
    3. Calculate payment status using client_service functions
    4. Generate missingPayments array
    5. Format periods and dates for frontend display
    
    This replaces the reliance on the deprecated client_payment_status view
    with more accurate calculations in Python.
    
    Returns: Client details dictionary with all nested objects for frontend
    """
    pass

def get_client_payment_history(client_id):
    """
    Get payment history for a specific client from frontend_payment_history view.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Query frontend_payment_history view with client_id filter
    2. Add pagination parameters (limit, offset)
    3. Order by receivedDate in descending order (newest first)
    4. Format dates and currency values for frontend
    
    The view handles:
    - Period formatting (converting month/quarter numbers to strings)
    - Document attachment status
    - Variance calculations
    
    Returns: List of payment dictionaries in frontend-expected format
    """
    pass

def get_providers():
    """
    Get all providers with their clients and total assets.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Query providers table for basic provider data
    2. For each provider, aggregate:
       - Count of associated clients (through contracts)
       - Sum of last_recorded_assets across clients
       - Total participants count
    3. Format results as expected by frontend
    
    Why this matters:
    - Provider view in sidebar needs this aggregated data
    - Used for grouping clients by provider
    
    Returns: List of provider dictionaries with aggregated metrics
    """
    pass

def create_payment(payment_data):
    """
    Create a new payment record.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Extract and validate required fields from payment_data
    2. Parse period format from frontend to database format
    3. Use transaction to:
       a. Insert payment record
       b. Let database triggers calculate variance
       c. Update client_metrics with latest payment info
    4. If document is attached, associate it with payment
    
    Why transactions matter:
    - Ensures all related updates happen together
    - Database triggers handle derived values automatically
    
    Returns: ID of the newly created payment
    """
    pass

def update_payment(payment_id, payment_data):
    """
    Update an existing payment record.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Fetch existing payment to preserve unchanged fields
    2. Merge new data with existing payment data
    3. Parse period format from frontend to database format
    4. Use transaction to:
       a. Soft-delete old payment (set valid_to)
       b. Insert new payment with updated values
       c. Let database triggers handle recalculating derived values
    
    Why soft-delete matters:
    - Preserves payment history
    - Maintains audit trail
    - Allows restoration if needed
    
    Returns: ID of the updated payment
    """
    pass

def delete_payment(payment_id):
    """
    Soft-delete a payment by setting valid_to.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Set valid_to on payment record to current timestamp
    2. Rely on triggers to update client_metrics and summaries
    
    This approach preserves the payment history while removing
    it from active queries that filter for valid_to IS NULL.
    
    Returns: Boolean indicating success
